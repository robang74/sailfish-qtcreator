Run rpmbuild. Execute just the %prep section of the RPM 'SPEC' file.

When a supported version control system (VCS) is used to manage the source tree, any changes introduced by executing the %prep section will be applied with the help of the VCS in order to keep your own changes safe and clearly separated.

Speaking the language of Git, the only supported VCS at the moment, new commits will be created â€“ one for each applied patch and a final one for changes introduced other way than by applying patches.

The above described behavior may be suppressed by the 'no-vcs-apply' configuration option.
