Use a particular snapshot of the build target. The snapshot name is determined by combining the original target name with the given <suffix>, separated with dot.

By default, i.e., when this option is not set, the snapshot with suffix 'default' is used.

When this option is set but no <suffix> was specified, '%pool' is assumed for compatibility with older sfdk versions. (Deprecated)

When <suffix> is '%pool[,<N>]', a temporary snapshot will be used from a pool of the optionally given size <N> (default: 5).  The actual suffix will follow the pattern 'pool.XXX'. Each temporary snapshot is used exclusively with single build tree at a time and it is reset automatically whenever it is taken into use with another build tree.

See the CLEAN BUILDS section for more information.
