=== Introduction

Sfdk divides its functionality into a number of commands available through the main executable.

    $ sfdk <command> <args>...

Pass '--help' together with a command name for the details on a particular command. Introductory guides and other information concerning multiple commands addressing a particular domain can be obtained with '--help-<domain>'. Alternatively, '--help-all' covers all domains on a single page.

    $ sfdk --help <command>
    $ sfdk --help-<domain>
    $ sfdk --help-all

Sfdk is strict about ordering any 'global options' (see GLOBAL OPTIONS) prior to a command name on the command line. Similarly, any non-global options ('command options') may only appear after the respective command name. The only exception to this rule are the various '--help*' options, which may be conveniently passed anywhere on the command line.

    $ sfdk ... <command> ... --help
    $ sfdk ... <command> ... --help-<domain>

=== Configuration

Many aspects of sfdk behavior are controlled with (persistent) 'configuration options' (see CONFIGURATION OPTIONS). Configuration can be maintained with the 'config' command.

Configuration changes may be applied globally (with the '--global' option) or just for the current (shell) session.  One-time configuration changes are possible with the global option '-c'.  Let’s exercise all three options and review the effect:

    $ sfdk config --global task=bug-1234
    $ sfdk config task=feature-5678
    $ sfdk -c task=bug-1234 config
    # ---- command scope ---------
    task = bug-1234

    # ---- session scope ---------
    # masked at command scope
    ;task = feature-5678

    # ---- global scope ---------
    # masked at session scope
    ;task = bug-1234

Options pushed higher on the stack override (mask) those appearing more lower – as stated conveniently in the output.

See the 'config' command for more details.
